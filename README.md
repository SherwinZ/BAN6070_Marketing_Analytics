# BAN6070_Marketing_Analytics

This repo stores my coursework on the marketing analytics class taught by Dr. Li, especially a smenatic network analysis for the market structure

## Amazon Reviews Semantic Network Analysis - R

It is a project led by me with my team "Hive". I designed the analysis framework and contributed to the lift calcutaion -- the core to the assignment -- and optimized the algorithm complexity so that it runs through under 10 minutes with millions of reviews. When other teams struggled purely calculating the Lift, my code allowed time for us to better and refine our analyses when the project has to be done within one week. 

I was also under the instruction of Gui Liberali, a co-author of Oded Netzer, the author of our reference article, during my exchange to Rotterdam
